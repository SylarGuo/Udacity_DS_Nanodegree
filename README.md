# Goal of this Project

Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian markets, graciously shared this dataset. Olist links small companies all over Brazil to channels with a single contract and no trouble. Those businesses may sell their goods on the Olist Store and have them sent straight to customers through Olist logistics partners. A seller is alerted once a buyer orders a product through Olist Store and is responsible for fulfilling that order. When the consumer receives the product or the projected delivery date approaches, he receives an email with a satisfaction survey where he may rate his purchase experience and leave some remarks.

This is a public Brazilian ecommerce dataset of Olist Store orders. From 2016 to 2018, the dataset consists about 100k orders placed on several Brazilian marketplaces. Its capabilities allow you to evaluate an order from a variety of perspectives, including order status, pricing, payment, and freight performance, as well as customer location, product qualities, and customer feedback. A geolocation dataset relating Brazilian zip codes to lat/lng coordinates was also available. This is real business data that has been anonymized, and in the review text, references to the companies and partners have been substituted with the names of Game of Thrones great houses.
