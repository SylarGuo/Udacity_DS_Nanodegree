# Goal of this Project

People use credit cards everyday and all the usage information is collected by credit card companies. Americans currently have 511.4 million credit cards and 61% of American consumers have at least one credit card, while the average person has four. Credit Card Issuing in the US Market reached 98.9 billion dollars in 2021.

The purpose of this analysis is to tackle the business problem of how credit card users are segmented. With this projectâ€™s analysis, advertisement companies could use these credit card users segments to improve marketing strategies such as campaign distribution optimization. Banks can also use this analysis to prevent credit card fraud, payment default and credit limit management problems with further analysis in the future.

In this notebook, we are going to answer the following questions:
1.   How to segement these credit card users?
2.   How many segmentations these credit card users should be in?
3.   How do we target them accordingly with different segements?
